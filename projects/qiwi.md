# Qiwi Project

**Qiwi** is a Shopify app designed to streamline the entire sourcing and order fulfillment process for merchants. It allows users to send sourcing requests to multiple suppliers, compare pricing, and choose the best option. Sourced products can be saved in the app and published to one or more connected stores. Qiwi automates the merchant order flow and also handles payments between merchants and suppliers.

The app integrates with Shopify APIs to manage stores, orders, and products, making it a complete solution for merchants. Suppliers also have a dedicated interface to respond to sourcing requests, fulfill orders, and provide performance metrics such as average processing times for quotes.
